    <h2>Operatrors & Expressions</h2>
    <h3>1. Add two Numbers</h3>
    <p>You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to add these two numbers.</p>
    <h5>Answer:</h5>
    <pre>           const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => 
            {
                let result = a + b;
                return result;
            };
    </pre>
    <h3>2. Find if the conditions are obeyed or not?</h3>
    <p>You are given two number first as A and second as B and check if both conditions (A < 10 and A > B) are satisfied or not with the help of operators.</p>
    <h5>Answer:</h5>
    <pre>
            const Is_Valid = (a,b) => 
            {
                if(a<10, a>b)
                return true;
                else
                return false;
            };
    </pre>
    <h3>3. Check the conditons</h3>
    <p>
        You are given two numbers A and B. You need to do the following checks: <br>
            1. if both are divisible by 10 console true. <br>
            2. if both are not divisible by 10 console false. <br>
            3. if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true. <br>
            Use operator to do this.
    </p>
    <h5>Answer:</h5>
    <pre>
            const Check = (A, B) =>
            {
                if ((A%10===0) || (B%10===0))
                return true;
                else
                return false;
            };
    </pre>
    <h3>4. Find the first digit of a 4 digit number</h3>
    <p>You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the first digit of that number.</p>
    <h5>Answer:</h5>
    <pre>
            const First_Digit = (n) =>
            {
                return Math.floor(n/1000);
            };
    </pre>
    <h3>5. Find the last digit of a 4 digit number</h3>
    <p>You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the last digit of that number.</p>
    <h5>Answer:</h5>
    <pre>
            const Last_Digit = (n) =>
            {
                return (n % 10);
            };
    </pre>
    <h3>6. Find the remainder</h3>
    <p>You are provided with two numbers A and B where A as divisor and B as  dividend.Your task is find the remainder.</p>
    <h5>Answer:</h5>
    <pre>
            const Find_the_remainder = (a,b) =>
            {
                return (b%a);
            };
    </pre>
    <h3>7. Multipy two Numbers</h3>
    <p>You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to multiply these two numbers.</p>
    <h5>Answer:</h5>
